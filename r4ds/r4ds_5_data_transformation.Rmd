5.1.3 Dplyr basics


Pick observations by their values (filter()).
Reorder the rows (arrange()).
Pick variables by their names (select()).
Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).
Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()).

group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group.


All verbs work similarly:

1) The first argument is a data frame.

2) The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names (without quotes).

3) The result is a new data frame.



5.2 Filter rows with filter()

Let's select all nyc flights from January 1st.

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1) 
```

If you want to print results and save a df as a variable wrap all in ().
```{r}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```

5.2.1 comparisons 
Using  = instead of == when checking equality can lead to float numbers
```{r}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
1 / 49 * 49 == 1 
```

To display infinite numbers use near()
```{r}
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,2)
near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)
```

5.2.2 logical operators

Boolean operators yourself: & is “and”, | is “or”, and ! is “not”. 

![All boolean operations in R. X is left hand circle, and y is right hand circle](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/01f4b6d39d2be8269740a3ad7946faa79f7243cf/8369a/diagrams/transform-logical.png)

To find all flights that departed in November OR December:
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12 )
```

This will only return all flights in November. To rewrite the code to include December we use month %in% c(november, december) 

```{r}
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11,12))
```

To find flights that were NOT delayed (arrival or dept.) more than 2 hours:

```{r}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```

5.2.3 Missing values

To determine if a value is missing use is.na()
```{r}
is.na(x)
```


To preserve missing values inxclude them
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

5.2.4 exercises

Find all flights: 
1.1) Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
```{r}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
```
1.2) Flew to Houston
```{r}
filter(flights, dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")
```

1.3) were operated by United, Americanm, or Delta

```{r}
filter(flights, carrier == "UA" | carrier == "AA" | carrier == "DL" )
```

1.4) Departed in summer ( July, August, September)

```{r}
filter(flights, month %in% c(1,8, 9))
```
